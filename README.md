# Single-cell-RNA-seq-data-integration-and-analysis
This repository contains R code for integrating scRNA seq datasets using 6 different approaches, evaluation and downstream analyses. The data was sourced from NCBI GEO data repository. The dataset (GSE162631) consists two samples of each tumor and normal endothelial cells of the brain. Seurat object was created for each sample and cells containing high mitochondrial transcripts were removed before the integration.
